In my learning of numpy ,pandas and matplotlib , I gained a strong foundation in basic data handling and analysis. Using NumPy, I learned how to create and manipulate
arrays, perform mathematical operations, and understand array broadcasting. With Pandas, I explored how to work with Series and DataFrames, load data from CSV files, 
handle missing values, filter and sort data, and perform simple groupings and aggregations. Finally, Matplotlib helped me visualize data using basic plots like line 
graphs, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots, allowing me to better understand patterns and trends in data. These tools together gave me the essential skills to
process, analyze, and visualize data in Python.
